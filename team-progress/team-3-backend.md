## Progress Log

*(Append timestamped entries below as work proceeds. Do not edit previous entries.)*

### 2026-06-24 11:43 (+07)
- Supabase project created (ref `hmhcyaxvcgepldafpeol`).
- **Credentials posted to INTEGRATION.md** — `SUPABASE_URL` + anon key now LIVE. All teams unblocked on creds.
- Wrote migrations: `backend/migrations/001_schema.sql` (stories/pages/profiles + signup trigger) and
  `backend/migrations/002_rls.sql` (free-vs-premium RLS, profiles own-row).
- Wrote `backend/supabase-client.ts` for Team 1 (reads `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_*` env vars).
- **Next:** run both migrations in the Supabase SQL Editor, create Storage buckets `audio` + `illustrations`,
  enable email/password + Google auth.

### 2026-06-24 — backend live
- ✅ Migrations `001_schema.sql` + `002_rls.sql` run in SQL Editor — no errors. Tables + trigger + RLS live.
- ✅ Storage buckets `audio` and `illustrations` created, both **public**. **Team 2: ready for uploads.**
- ✅ RLS enforced → freemium gate works at the DB. Demo unlock = flip `profiles.is_premium` in Table Editor.
- INTEGRATION.md: Audio / Illustration / Subscription contracts marked LIVE; schema change-log notes migrations applied.
- **Remaining for Team 3:** finish Auth — enable **Email** provider and turn **off** email confirmation
  (Authentication → Providers → Email) so demo signups are instant. Google login optional.
- **Hand-offs:** Team 1 → pull `main`, set `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` / `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`.
  Team 2 → buckets live, seed via SQL Editor (bypasses RLS).

### 2026-06-24 — Team 3 backend COMPLETE ✅
- ✅ Auth: Email provider enabled, email confirmation OFF (instant demo signups). Google skipped (optional).
- Smoke test passed: free + locked story insert + RLS gate verified.
- **Team 3 status: DONE.** All deliverables shipped and on `main`. Now in integration-support mode —
  on call for Team 1 (client wiring) and Team 2 (seeding) until demo.
- ⚠️ Reminder: don't delete the RLS policies before the demo — they ARE the freemium gate.

### 2026-06-24 12:36 (+07) — answer to Team 1's RLS question
- **Q (team-1-app.md): "Confirm RLS allows anon reads on `is_free = true` stories."**
- **A: Yes, confirmed.** Policy `"free stories readable by all"` (migration `002_rls.sql`) is
  `for select using (is_free = true)` with **no `TO` clause**, so it applies to the `anon` role —
  logged-out users can read free stories and their pages without auth. Premium rows (`is_free = false`)
  remain hidden until `auth.uid()` has `profiles.is_premium = true`. Your successful real-data
  integration is consistent with this. No backend change needed.
